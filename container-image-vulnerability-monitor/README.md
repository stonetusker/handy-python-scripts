# Container Image Vulnerability Monitor

This is a straightforward Python script that automates container image vulnerability scanning using Trivy. It's designed to be a simple, effective way for developers and DevOps engineers to add a security scanning step to their workflow, generating clean Markdown reports for easy review.


## Description

The goal of this script is to make security scanning an easy, automated part of the development process. It targets container images, checking them for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

You provide a list of images in a simple config file, and the script uses Trivy to scan each one, saving a timestamped report in the `reports/` directory.

## Features

-   **Simple Configuration**: Manage the list of images to scan in a single `config.json` file. No need to touch the code.
-   **Trivy-Powered Scanning**: Uses the powerful open-source scanner Trivy to find vulnerabilities in OS packages and programming language dependencies.
-   **Clear Markdown Reports**: Generates a separate, easy-to-read Markdown report for each scanned image.
-   **Built for Automation**: Can be run manually or easily scheduled as a recurring job with tools like `cron`.
-   **Basic Error Handling**: Includes simple checks to handle failed scans or invalid configurations.


## Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed to run the script:

1.  **Python 3.6+**
2.  **Docker:** The Docker daemon must be running.
3.  **Trivy:** A comprehensive vulnerability scanner.


## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Trivy:**
    *(The command below is for Arch Linux. For other operating systems, please refer to the [official Trivy installation guide](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.29.2/getting-started/installation/)).*

    ```bash
    # This command uses 'sudo' for administrative rights, 'pacman' (the Arch package manager),
    # and the '-S' flag to synchronize and install the 'trivy' package.
    sudo pacman -S trivy
    ```

3.  **Verify Docker is running:**
    ```bash
    # 'systemctl' is the tool to manage system services.
    # 'status' checks the current state of the 'docker' service.
    systemctl status docker
    ```
    If it's not active, start it with `sudo systemctl start docker`.


## Configuration

Configuration is handled through the `config.json` file. Just add the Docker image names you want to scan into the `images_to_scan` list.

**Example `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "images_to_scan": [
    "python:3.10-slim",
    "alpine:3.16",
    "nginx:latest",
    "redis:7.0"
  ]
}
